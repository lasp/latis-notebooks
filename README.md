# LaTiS Notebooks
This repo stores Jupyter Notebooks about interacting with LaTiS through Python.

## Exploring a notebook
### Load it in Binder
* To explore a notebook, click on the Binder link below. This will enable you to try the notebook (including code execution and interactive elements) without installing something locally on your computer.
* **Note**: if you click on the Binder link for the first time, the project will take a moment to load in Binder (~2 min). In the meantime, you will have access to a static version of the notebook that you can browse.
* While in the notebook, you are free to change anything you want to changeâ€”you cannot _break_ anything in the repository (just in your Binder version).
